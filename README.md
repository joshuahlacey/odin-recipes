Hello. This is my 3rd time attempting TOP and I'm enjoying the new curriculum a lot better than the old one. This project is going to be a demonstration of the skills I've learned this far. For example

- Using a Linux OS
- Navigating using Terminal
- Making and committing to Github using git
- Create and editing code in VSCode
- Using HTML to create a small and simple website which will utilize things like a boilerplate, elements, attributes, tags, and images
